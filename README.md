# studyBrogue-mac

** working on migrating Objective-C out of the code on the [xcode-11.1-pregen-migration branch](https://github.com/tehdarthvid/studyBrogue-mac/tree/xcode-11.1-pregen-migration) **

Using Brian Walker's Brouge (Mac) source to learn a few things about developing on/for Mac.

Base code is from Brogue v1.7.5 (Mac sources) by Brian "Pender" Walker, which can be found on https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/.
Brogue is an awesome free roguelike! Go and play it!

When this project started, the latest version of Brogue was v1.7.5, which doesn't just "build on one click" when the sources are loaded on Xcode v11.1 on macOS v10.14.6. This is in part documenting my attempt to get it working on said env, then playing around from there, hoping to learn a few things on the way. :)
